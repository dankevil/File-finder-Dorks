For a full Chrome extension implementation, you would need to create the following icon files:

1. icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
2. icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
3. icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

These icon files should be created by a designer or generated using an icon creation tool.

For testing purposes, you can create simple square PNG files with the dimensions listed above.

The icons should represent the functionality of finding open directories, such as a folder with a magnifying glass.
