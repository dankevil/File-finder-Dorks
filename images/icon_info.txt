For the extension to function correctly, you need to create an icon.png file in this directory.

You can:
1. Create a simple square PNG file named "icon.png"
2. Use an online icon generator to create a folder with magnifying glass icon
3. Download a free icon from a stock website

The manifest.json is configured to use the same icon file for all sizes (16px, 48px, and 128px).
For better quality, you may want to create separate optimized versions for each size:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

If you create these separate files, update the manifest.json to point to these specific files instead of the generic icon.png.
